<h2>Accessibility Review of the Bordentown Regional High School Home Page</h2>
<ul>
<li>Problems</li>
<ul><li>Unnecessary amounts of text in some areas (all of which have internal links to more information on the subject)</li>
<li>14 links to PDF documents</li>
<li>1 "noscript" element</li></ul>
<li>Solutions</li>
<ul><li>Include less alternate text and limit captions to breif summaries</li>
<li>Have alternate ways to access PDF documents in case there is an accessibility problem</li>
<li>Ensure that the "noscript" content is visible because it will only be seen by users who have JavaScript turned off</li></ul>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<p class="review">Considering the size of the Bordentown Regional High School website, there are very few bugs throughout the code. Overall, the website is works very well and 
allows the users to understand the content while still presenting it in a creative way. However, in order to maximize efficiency, the website should have smaller captions and provide
alternative ways to access some key elements. This will speed up the loading time and will make it much easier for users to navigate the site.</p>

<h2>Usability Study

<a href="http://art.yale.edu/">Yale Art Department</a></h2>
<ul><li><h3>Method</h3></li>
	<ul><li>Target Audience</li>
		<ul><li>Yale art students and staff</li></ul>
	<li>Representative Tasks</li>
		<ul><li>Task 1: find the summer programs</li>
		<li>Task 2: find a beginnners art course</li>
		<li>Task 3: find out who to contact to enroll in the course</li></ul>
	</ul>
<li><h3>Results</h3></li>
	<ul><li>Task 1</li>
		<ul><li>We scrolled around the hope page and the courses page for a while before realizing that there was a tab for summer courses in the directory.</li></ul>
	<li>Task 2</li>
		<ul><li>Summer programs were split into 2 categories, Norfolk and New Haven. Norfolk was a dead end and New Haven had course information, but none on the beginner level.
		We then went back to the courses tab and still could not find it. We never completed this task.</li></ul>
	<li>Task 3</li>
		<ul><li>We never attempted to complete this task.</li></ul>
	</ul>
<li><h3>Discussion</h3></li>
	<ul><li>This is the worst web page design I have ever used. If it was not for a class assignment, I would have left the second I had opened the home page. It is impossible
	to find anything and there is not standard design, leaving the user to guess and check in order to find content. The website looks artistic, which is obviously what they were
	going for, but the Yale art department is in desperate need of organization skills.</li></ul>

<h2>Usability Study
<br />
<a href="https://www.bordentown.k12.nj.us/">Bordentown Regional School District</a></h2>
<ul><li><h3>Method</h3></li>
	<ul><li>Target Audience</li>
		<ul><li>Bordentown students, staff, and parents</li></ul>
	<li>Representative Tasks</li>
		<ul><li>Task 1: find the middle school math department</li>
		<li>Task 2: find someone who teaches algebra 1</li>
		<li>Task 3: find their contact information</li></ul>
	</ul>
<li><h3>Results</h3></li>
	<ul><li>Task 1</li>
		<ul><li>There was no tab for the math department, so I had to search math in the staff directory to find the math teachers' websites.</li></ul>
	<li>Task 2</li>
		<ul><li>There were not any search results for "algebra 1" so I had to find the teachers by trial and error.</li></ul>
	<li>Task 3</li>
		<ul><li>The teacher websites had contact information that was easy to access.</li></ul>
	</ul>
<li><h3>Discussion</h3></li>
	<ul><li>For the most part, the website was organized and easy to use. However, I would recommend making a directory for the different departments within the school.
	This would have helped me save time when I was looking for the middle school math department. Teachers should also make the specific class that they teach more prominent
	on their web page.</li></ul>

		<ul><li>We easily found the tab in the middle of the home page in bold letters.</li></ul>
	<li>Task 2</li>
		<ul><li>We scrolled around on the page for a minute before finding a link to the 2014 conference information.</li></ul>

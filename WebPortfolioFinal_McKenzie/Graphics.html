<h3> Unit 4: M1-L1 </h3>
<ul><li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordentown,_New_Jersey">Wikipedia</a></li>
		<ul><li>What do you feel is the purpose of the graphics on the page you selected?</li>
				<p class="review">The graphics on the Bordentown Wikipedia page are meant to enhance the response and provide more information on the topic.
				For example, the image of the Clara Barton Schoolhouse is meant to help the reader to understand the content about the history of the building.</p>
		<li>How well does the page you selected meet these guidelines? Which guidelines does it do especially well on, if any? Which guidelines does it fail to meet?</li>
				<p class="review">For the most part, the graphics on the Bordentown Wikipedia page fit the guidelines. However, I also think that the web page could use more images. 
				It would also convey the same information without the graphics. Therefore, the graphics fit the guidelines but do not do very much to make
				the page visually appealing.</p></ul>
<li><a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bi4gs34olYFhhwsLuB-aeYGB40TszG3r/view">Purpose and Guidelines for better use of Web Graphics</a></li>
		<ul><li>Look over the three items that discuss the purpose of graphics in web design. Why do you think it is important that generally speaking it is good practice to 
		let the content of the page lead the graphics on the page and not the other way around? Can you think of any situations where this may not be the case?</li>
				<p class="review">The purpose of the graphics on a web page is to maintain visual appeal and communicate ideas visually. If the content is based on the 
				graphics, it might be hard to explain the connection between different graphics, or harder to maintain visual structure and appeal within the web page.</p></ul>
<li><a href = "http://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg3/11-graphics/index.html">Graphics: Web Style Guide 3</a></li>
		<ul><li>For each guideline, think about why you think that guideline is important to web design. Remember what you learned about good design 
		principles and accessibility in Unit 1. Can you think of any additional guidelines for effective use of web graphics that have not been listed?</li>
				<p class="review">If you change the size of an image, make sure that the borders are to scale of the original borders. A square image should not be changed 
				to a rectangle, and so on.</p></ul>
</ul>

<h3> Unit 4: M1-L2 </h3>
<ul><li>Do you think images on the web are protected by copyright law?</li>
<p class="review">Yes, I think that the majority of the images on the web are protected by copyright law. Unless the author of the work is unknown,or has passed away a long time ago,
the majority of images on the web would most likely be considered a form of art, and therefore protected by copyright law.</p>
<li>How might copyright law impact your use of graphics in web pages?</li>
<p class="review">Copyright law would imapct my use of graphics in web pages by changing how I determine if I can use an image or not. In order to use certain images, I would 
need either a license or permission from whoever designed the image. Without one of these, using the image on my web page would be against copyright law. Even images in public
archives might need a license. Therefore, I should use more images from databases that have permitted students to use their work.</p></ul>

<h3> Unit 4: M2-L1 </h3>
<h2 class ="filetypes">Graphic File Types</h2>
<ul><li>For each of the five images, which file format would be most appropriate for putting that image on a web page?</li>
<ul><li>Image 1: Graph</li><p class="review">SVG</p>
<li>Image 2: Monkey</li><p class="review">JPG</p>
<li>Image 3: Mountain</li><p class="review">JPG</p>
<li>Image 4: Puzzle Pieces (clip art)</li><p class="review">PNG</p>
<li>Image 5: Stop Sign (clip art)</li><p class="review">SVG or PNG, depending on whether the background needs to be transparent or not</p></ul></ul>

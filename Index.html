			<p class="review">
			In this unit, we learned about html and tags. This helped us to code our web pages and use basic html tags. I learned the difference between 
			container tags and non container tags, html and css, and why web standards are important.
			Throughout this unit, we have learned how to add hyperlinks, images, tables, ordered and unordered lists, and more to my web pages.
			</p>
		<li><strong>Unit 3: Formatting Web Pages with Style Sheet Modules</strong>
		<ul>
		<li>Module 1: Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets</li>
		<li>Module 2: Color in CSS</li>
		<li>Module 3: Typography in CSS</li>
		<li>Module 4: The Box Model in CSS</li>
		<li>Module 5: The Rold of ID and Class in CSS</li>
		<li>Module 6: Page Layout Techniques</li>
		<li>Module 7: Reflections</li>
		</ul></li>
			<p class="review">
			In the css unit, I learned how to style the html web pages that I created by linking them to a corresponding style sheet.
			I was also able to use the ideas about color theory that we learned in unit one to give my web page an interesting color scheme. We experimented with css to give our
			web pages different borders, fonts, and colors. I also learned the difference between html and css and what they are each used for.
			</p>
		<li><strong>Unit 4: Web Graphics</strong>
		<ul>
		<li>Module 1: Introduction to Web Graphics</li>
		<li>Module 2: Creating a Web Photo Album</li>
		<li>Module 3: Creating a Button</li>
		<li>Module 4: Creating a Web Page Banner</li>
		<li>Module 5: Reflections</li>
		</ul></li>
			<p class="review">
			In the graphics unit, we learned about copyright laws for images on the web. We had to find these images, edit them, and use them to code a photo album.
			Our images were linked to larger versions of the graphics that were easier to see. I also was able to create a button to link to my email and my photo album.
			We used Photoshop to create the button and saved them as gifs. Lastly, we created favicons, which are the images in the corner of the address bar that are used to help identify
			the website opened. To summarize, we coded different types of graphics into our web page to enhance the overall style and to keep the users' attention.

		<li><strong>Unit 5: JavaScript</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li>Module 1: Overview of Scripting on the Web Page</li>
		<li>Module 2: JavaScript</li>
		<li>Module 3: Reflections</li>
		</ul>
			<p class="review">
			In this unit, we used Javascript to write scripts that enhanced our web page. This included making a clock, styling it, and making a button. We worked on our client side scripts and 
			learned JavaScript syntax. Another lesson in this unit was debugging our code. I was able to identify and fix different bugs within JavaScript. When making our clocks, 
			we used a JavaScript object to retrieve data, meaning that we used the object to find the time from a web database. Later on, we used "if", "then", and "else" loops and learned how to use the 
			"setInterval()" tag. Lastly, we used CSS to style the elements that we created with JavaScript. In conclusion, this unit helped us to incorporate JavaScript into our HTML web pages.

		<li><strong>Unit 6: Quality Control</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li>Module 1: Validating Websites</li>
		<li>Module 2: Testing Usability</li>
		<li>Module 3: Reflections</li>
		</ul>
			<p class="review">
			In this unit, we learned how to use quality control to improve the efficiency of our websites. There are tools that can be used online to recommend changes
			and evaluate your website. However, it is just as effective to observe somebody completing simple "representative tasks". We worked together to evaluate the efficiency	of
			multiple websites and expirienced the differences in quality control. In conclusion, this unit taught us how important it is to have an easy to use, and organized website.
			</p>
		<li><strong>Unit 7: Website Management and Authoring Tools</strong></li>
		<ul>
		<li>Module 1: Web Authoring Software</li>
		<li>Module 2: Publishing on the Web</li>
		<li>Module 3: Reflections</li>
		</ul>
			<p class="review">
			In this unit, we learned about web authoring programs, applications to help create websites without requiring the user to know HTML and CSS that are easy to use and save time.
			These tools use templates and are easily customizable to ensure that your website is efficient and organized. Throughout this unit, we evaluated different web authoring programs
			and compared them to find which one would work best for our "client". We were also able to look at site management tools and discussed content management systems, tools used to 
			update websites without having to change the entire thing. Lastly, in unit 7 we learned how to publish a website on the web. In conclusion, we learned that there are other, faster
			ways to code than HTML, but you should always make sure that you are using a capable web authoring program and maintain an organized website.
